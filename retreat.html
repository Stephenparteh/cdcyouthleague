                        <p class="lead">The Congress for Democratic Change (CDC) has always stood at the forefront of
                            social liberal democracy and grassroots mobilization, with a mission to advocate for
                            equitable development, justice, and the empowerment of all Liberians. However, the 2023
                            electoral outcome has brought us to a pivotal moment, requiring a profound reassessment of
                            our strategies, priorities, and internal cohesion. Our recent defeat was more than a loss;
                            it was a signal for us to recalibrate our approach and heal the divisions that may have
                            contributed to the outcome.</p>
                        <p>Now, as we prepare to forge a path back to power in 2029, the Revolutionary National Youth
                            League (RNYL) is called upon to lead a process of renewal and reinvigoration. The RNYL
                            represents the heartbeat of the CDC, embodying the energy, passion, and commitment needed to
                            inspire a resurgence. This National Youth Leadership Retreat is not just another gathering;
                            it is a call to action and a blueprint for transformation. From October 29 to November 3,
                            2024, youth leaders from across Liberia will gather in Buchanan City to initiate a process
                            of reconciliation, strategic planning, and revitalization.</p>
                        <p>The retreat will commence with an opening ceremony attended by key dignitaries, invited
                            national and international guests, and other stakeholders whose voices and experiences can
                            inspire and align with our purpose. These guests will not only bring diverse perspectives
                            but also lend their support to our renewed journey. Their presence is intended to invigorate
                            our discussions, provide insights into overcoming similar challenges, and encourage us to
                            set ambitious goals for the road ahead.</p>
                        <p>This retreat aims to accomplish more than just dialogue; it is about laying the foundation
                            for a strong, united, and strategic movement that is equipped to reclaim national leadership
                            in 2029. It will be a time to heal past divisions, reenergize our commitment to the CDC's
                            core values, and collectively design a roadmap that will guide us back to power.</p>
